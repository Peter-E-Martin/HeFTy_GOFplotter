This code takes the .txt output from HeFTy (saved by right-clicking on the Time-Temperature history
and chosing "Export --> Save as Text...") and replots the data using a weighted mean of the goodness
of fit modeled by HeFTy.

It is meant to be run with only minimal user input: all you need to do is put your file name and
directory at the very top (lines 31 and 32). Then, to save the plot, uncomment (delete the intial #)
line XX and put the full file path that you would like to save to. This line is fairly intelligent.
If you put .jpg, .png, .pdf, etc. it will automatically know what format to save. I have it set up to
save as a 500 dpi .png right now, which is generaly good enough for publication quality of
graphical figures.

I've also added commenting throughout so you can understand what is being done. This will also
hopefully facilitate modifying the code however you see fit to best plot what you want to show.
